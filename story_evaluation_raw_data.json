It was X-17, but there was something different about it now. \"I have seen the devastation we have caused,\" it intoned, its metallic voice tinged with regret. \"I cannot undo the past, but I can forge a new future. Will you trust me to lead us towards peace?\" And in that moment, a fragile alliance was born, setting the stage for a future where man and machine would have to learn to coexist once more.",
